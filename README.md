# ConnectX

ConnectX is a terminal-based imitation of the game Connect-Four. Before starting the game, it will asks to specify an amount of consecutive discs that need to be connected for a victory. Then, the game will alternate between two players. Each player may slot a disc during their turn, and the winner is the player who forms a pattern of discs that connect horizontally, vertcally or diagonally.
